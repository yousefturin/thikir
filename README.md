# Mufarradun

Welcome to the showcase of Mufarradun, a personal project that has been meticulously crafted over five months with a singular vision: to provide an immersive and ad-free experience for exploring Islamic remembrance. Frustrated by the inundation of ads in existing applications within this category, I embarked on a journey to create a solution that not only met my own needs but also resonated with others seeking a seamless and distraction-free experience.

## Overview

As a fourth-year computer engineering student, I embraced the challenge of mastering a new programming language to bring my vision to life. React Native emerged as the perfect choice, offering the versatility to develop for both iOS and Android platforms simultaneously. What began as a personal endeavor soon evolved into a passion project, as I delved into the intricacies of design, development, and rigorous testing.

## Features

Enter Mufarradun – a comprehensive application designed to enrich one's spiritual journey. With features ranging from receiving notifications for specific actions to tracking glorification counts, from saving favorite supplications to accessing daily verses of the Quran, Hadith, and invocations, Mufarradun offers a multifaceted approach to Islamic exploration.

## Customization

But Mufarradun isn't just about functionality – it's about customization and user experience. Users can personalize their experience with customizable fonts, themes, and color schemes, ensuring a tailored interface that reflects individual preferences. With language support for English and Arabic, Mufarradun transcends cultural boundaries to reach a global audience.
